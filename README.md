# This code was written for the Mcdonald Observatory as part of developing a program to help scientists predict data quality given observing conditions. To generate the model, previous observing data is needed as well as the corresponding observing conditions. Observation data is taken from the LS2 instrument and observing conditions are taken from the guider cameras.

# This code compiles guider data for a given observation period. The LS2 data is used to identity the data and time of the observation so the corresponding guider data can be located. Guider data has the parameters: 2 pupils, 2 wavefront sensors, DIMM, mirror segment alignment, 2 transparencies each in 3 filters, 2 sky surface brightnesses each in 3 filters, sundown (bool for QA), and below 18 deg (bool for QA). For parameters with 2 components the average value is reported when components are in agreement (within 15%). When one component failed to record (ie outside FOV), the other components value is reported. If the components are both measured but do not agree then no value is reported and the observation will not be used in the final model.
